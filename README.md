# backend-testing

a repo for testing out Node, Express, and MongoDB integration

[x] 3.1 - Setting up Express Routes

- _Implement a Node application that returns a hardcoded list of phonebook entries from the address http://localhost:3001/api/persons._

[x] 3.2 - Server metadata

- _Implement a page at the address http://localhost:3001/info that shows the time that the request was received and how many entries are in the phonebook at the time of processing the request._

[ ] 3.3 - Display single entries (in a RESTful way)

- _Implement the functionality for displaying the information for a single phonebook entry. The url for getting the data for a person with the id 5 should be http://localhost:3001/api/persons/5_
- _If an entry for the given id is not found, the server has to respond with the appropriate status code._
